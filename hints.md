### ðŸ’¡ **Hints for Implementation**

* Use state to track current active light.
* Use `setTimeout` (or `setInterval`) in auto mode.
* Clear timers on unmount or mode switch.
* Ensure only one light is active at a time by conditional class application.
* Think modular: separate visual logic from timing logic.
